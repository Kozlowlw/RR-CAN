# RR-CAN
Archive of my ada.rose-hulman.edu gitlab senior project for Rolls-Royce.
My main contributions were the code/cht and code/cht2 packages.
I was in charge of researching and implementing commong vulnerabilities that could be used on any automotive CAN network.
The UDS and ISO-TP services do not work (pyvit issue).
The CORRUPT attack method will freeze the BeagleBone Black in Code/CHT2/hack.py. Do a full power reset to bring back the interface.
The grapher.py file located in Code/CHT2/ is an old file. The newest one was lost and as this is an archive I will not be updating it.
